# On the Effectiveness of Parameter Efficient Methods: Sparsity and FFNs Matter
Offical Repo for paper []().
This README incorporates results from [`HuggingFace Repo GLUE README`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/text-classification/README.md)
## Environment
Here are the steps to create the environment from scratch. We provide an exported .yml file using conda in `env/env.yml`, yet it should only be used as a reference. We experience problems directly creating a conda env from this file. We presuppose the installation of `conda`.

```bash
# create conda env hgf, change name if needed
conda env create -n hgf python=3.8.13 -y
conda activate hgf
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install transformers==4.22.0
pip install datasets==2.1.0
# for easy debugging
pip install debugpy
```

## GLUE tasks

Based on the script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py).

Fine-tuning the library models for sequence classification on the GLUE benchmark: [General Language Understanding
Evaluation](https://gluebenchmark.com/). 

GLUE is made up of a total of 9 different tasks. Here is how to run the script on one of them:

<!-- ```bash
export TASK_NAME=mrpc

python run_glue.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir /tmp/$TASK_NAME/
``` -->

where task name can be one of cola, sst2, mrpc, stsb, qqp, mnli, qnli, rte, wnli.

We get the following results on the dev set of the benchmark with the previous commands (with an exception for MRPC and
WNLI which are tiny and where we used 5 epochs instead of 3). Trainings are seeded so you should obtain the same
results with PyTorch 1.6.0 (and close results with different versions), training times are given for information (a
single Titan RTX was used):

| Task  | Metric                       | Result      | Training time |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| CoLA  | Matthews corr                | 56.53       | 3:17          |
| SST-2 | Accuracy                     | 92.32       | 26:06         |
| MRPC  | F1/Accuracy                  | 88.85/84.07 | 2:21          |
| STS-B | Pearson/Spearman corr.       | 88.64/88.48 | 2:13          |
| QQP   | Accuracy/F1                  | 90.71/87.49 | 2:22:26       |
| MNLI  | Matched acc./Mismatched acc. | 83.91/84.10 | 2:35:23       |
| QNLI  | Accuracy                     | 90.66       | 40:57         |
| RTE   | Accuracy                     | 65.70       | 57            |
| WNLI  | Accuracy                     | 56.34       | 24            |

Some of these results are significantly different from the ones reported on the test set of GLUE benchmark on the
website. For QQP and WNLI, please refer to [FAQ #12](https://gluebenchmark.com/faq) on the website.




### Mixed precision training

If you have a GPU with mixed precision capabilities (architecture Pascal or more recent), you can use mixed precision
training with PyTorch 1.6.0 or latest, or by installing the [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library for previous
versions. Just add the flag `--fp16` to your command launching one of the scripts mentioned above!

Using mixed precision training usually results in 2x-speedup for training with the same final results:

| Task  | Metric                       | Result      | Training time | Result (FP16) | Training time (FP16) |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| CoLA  | Matthews corr                | 56.53       | 3:17          | 56.78         | 1:41                 |
| SST-2 | Accuracy                     | 92.32       | 26:06         | 91.74         | 13:11                |
